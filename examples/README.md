# Examples

This project includes the following two examples:

- [`print_hex.cpp`](./print_hex.cpp):
  Prints the hexadecimal representation of the given number.
  This code returns an error if the provided input is not a number.
  This example demonstrates the basic flow of error handling and how to return an error object from a function.

- [`read_file.cpp`](./read_file.cpp):
  Reads a file from the given path and prints its content.
  This code returns an error if it fails to open the file.
  This example illustrates the same error handling flow but with examples of how to create an error object with a formatted message.
