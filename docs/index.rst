Errors C++
=============

Error C++ is a `C++`_ package that provides utilities for error handling.
This package mainly consists of the `errors::Error` class, representing an object that may contain an error.

This package serves as an alternative to error handling using `try-catch exceptions`_, commonly found in C++ code.
It facilitates error handling by returning values, following the style of `Go's error handling`_.

Key Features
------------

This package provides the following key features:

- Error handling in the style of Go  by returning an `errors::Error`.
- Support for creating errors in the style of `fmtlib`_ using `errors::format`.
- Direct printing of `errors::Error` using C++ streams and fmtlib.

Integration
-----------

To integrate this package into your C++ project, you can build and install it locally using `CMake`_:

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -B build .
   cmake --build build --config Release
   cmake --install build

Once installed, you can use it in your CMake project as the `Errors` package:

.. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(Errors 1.0.0 REQUIRED CONFIG)

   add_executable(foo foo.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE errors::errors)

Alternatively, you can also integrate this package using `CPM.cmake`_:

.. code-block:: cmake

   cpmaddpackage(gh:threeal/errors-cpp@1.0.0)

   add_executable(foo foo.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE errors::errors)

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org/
.. _CPM.cmake: https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake


Usage
-----

This package contains an `errors::Error` class, which represents an error object.
Functions that may produce errors should return this object so that the error can be handled properly.

.. code-block:: cpp

   errors::Error read_file(const char* filepath);

   int main() {
     const auto err = read_file(filepath);
     if (err) {
       // Handle the error.
     }

     // Continue processing if no error.
   }

For functions returning `errors::Error`, use `errors::nil` function to signify no error or return an error object created from the `errors::make` function.

.. code-block:: cpp

   errors::Error read_file(const char* filepath) {
     std::ifstream file(filepath);
     if (!file.is_open()) {
       return errors::make("failed to open file");
     }

     // Process with no error.

     return errors::nil();
   }

Alternatively, an error object can also be created with a formatted message in the style of fmtlib using `errors::format` function.

.. code-block:: cpp

   if (!file.is_open()) {
     return errors::format("failed to open '{}'", filepath);
   }
