Error C++ is a [C++](https://isocpp.org/) package that provides utilities for error handling.
This package mainly consists of the `errors::Error` class, representing an object that may contain an error.

This package serves as an alternative to error handling using [try-catch exceptions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/try_catch), commonly found in C++ code.
It facilitates error handling by returning values, following the style of [Go's error handling](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go).
